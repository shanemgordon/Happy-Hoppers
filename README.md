Full stack brawler game built with HTML, CSS, Javascript and Node.js

This project was created by me and a friend of mine sophomore year of high school. My friend was interested in video game art/design, and I was interested in further
solidifying my knowledge of full stack web development with Node.js. This project was hosted on a Plesk cloud server for a year, then archived to rest here on Github

In the future when I begin studying web development again I plan on remastering this game with better-chosen netcode. As this was written by a high school version of
myself, it is admittedly not a paragon of commenting, structure or even functionality. However, it does represent over three months of concentrated effort to study and
use the fundamental systems of Node.js. In the future, I plan to completely remake the game and some of the art assets involved. This new version will use my newfound
knowledge of websocketing and UDP net messages for a more reliable and robust netcode.

In the mean time, feel free to enjoy what I was able to build earlier in my career along with its wacky art and story provided by my former classmate, who now studies
design at Syracuse
